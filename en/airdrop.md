# Significance of Review
At present, with the development of cryptocurrencies, it is no longer the era where participating in air drops can earn money. The current airdrop returns are relatively low and may even be reversed. There are also some projects that cool down after participating in air drops. Therefore, it is not enough to only display airdrop information, but also to evaluate the quality of airdrops.
